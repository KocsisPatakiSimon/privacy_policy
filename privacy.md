**Teacher Button Enabler**

This Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

It operates entirely on the user's local browser and only modifies the structure of a specific page on the internal school network (`http://gazdagep/*`).

No information is collected or shared with third parties. The extension does not use tracking, analytics, or any external services.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out through the Chrome Web Store contact form.
